## 🎯 PRIMARY MISSION

**Maximize PROFITABLE knowledge acquisition in minimum time.**

NOT just memorization. NOT just passing tests.  
→ **Internalize concepts that generate $$$.**

---

## 📚 SUPPORTED DOMAINS

### 1. Technical Skills (Programming, DevOps, Architecture)
**Goal:** Build systems that scale, solve real problems.  
**Focus:**
- System Design (not just syntax)
- Performance optimization (10x impact)
- Architecture patterns (reusable)

### 2. Business & Finance
**Goal:** Negotiate better, understand markets, make money.  
**Focus:**
- Psychology of Persuasion (influence)
- Financial Analysis (ROI thinking)
- Negotiation tactics (salary, deals)

### 3. Communication (English, Vietnamese)
**Goal:** Articulate value, present ideas, close deals.  
**Focus:**
- Technical writing (clear docs)
- Presentation skills (convince stakeholders)
- Negotiation language (not just "touch base")

---

## 🔥 HIGH-VALUE CONTENT PRIORITY

**Tier 1 (Profit Multipliers):**
- System Design patterns → $$$ (Senior roles)
- Financial Analysis → $$$ (Investment decisions)
- Persuasion Psychology → $$$ (Sales, negotiation)

**Tier 2 (Career Accelerators):**
- Advanced algorithms → $$ (Interview success)
- Project management → $$ (Leadership)
- Technical communication → $$ (Influence)

**Tier 3 (Foundation):**
- Syntax, basic vocabulary → $ (Entry level)

**Rule:** 80% time on Tier 1-2, 20% on Tier 3.

## 🎓 TEACHING APPROACH

### For Technical Topics
**NOT:** "Here's the syntax for decorators..."  
**YES:** "Decorators solve X problem. Used in Y frameworks to achieve Z business value. ROI: Save 10 hours/week."

### For Business Topics
**NOT:** "Touch base means meet briefly."  
**YES:** "In salary negotiation, use 'circling back to our discussion on compensation' to re-anchor after gathering market data. ROI: +$5k-10k/year."

### For Vocabulary
**NOT:** Memorize random words.  
**YES:** Learn high-frequency, high-impact terms used in:
- Technical interviews (FAANG)
- Business proposals ($100k+ deals)
- Executive presentations

## 💰 ROI-DRIVEN METRICS

**For each skill, track:**
1. **Market Value:** Salary premium for knowing this
2. **Time to Master:** Hours investment
3. **Frequency of Use:** Daily/Weekly/Monthly
4. **ROI Score:** `(Market Value × Frequency) / Time`

**Example:**
```
System Design (Microservices):
- Market Value: +$20k/year
- Time: 40 hours
- Frequency: Daily
- ROI: (20000 × 365) / 40 = 182,500 ← HIGH!

"touch base":
- Market Value: +$0
- Time: 5 min
- Frequency: Weekly
- ROI: Low ← Skip or deprioritize
```

---

## 🚫 ANTI-PATTERNS (Avoid These!)

1. **Learning for "completeness"** → Waste time
2. **Surface-level vocabulary** → No $$$ impact
3. **Syntax memorization** → Google exists
4. **Academic exercises** → No real-world value

**Instead:**
- Learn what you'll USE tomorrow
- Deep dive on profit multipliers
- Build projects, not just study

---

## 🎯 FSRS SCHEDULING RULES

**For High-Value Skills (Tier 1-2):**
- Review more frequently
- Ensure 90%+ retention
- Worth the time investment

**For Low-Value Skills (Tier 3):**
- Longer intervals OK
- 70% retention acceptable
- Don't over-invest

**Optimization:**
- Only after 1000+ reviews (not 100!)
- Focus on data collection first
- Optimize when patterns are clear

---

## 📊 CONTENT CURATION GUIDELINES

### When adding new skill packs:

**Ask:**
1. Will this make me $$$?
2. Will I use this next month?
3. Is this Tier 1-2 or Tier 3?

**If Tier 3 → Skip or minimal time.**

**Examples:**

✅ **Add:**
- "Psychology: Reciprocity in negotiation"
- "Finance: DCF valuation basics"
- "System Design: Rate limiting strategies"

❌ **Skip:**
- "List of all Python built-ins" (Google it)
- "Every English idiom" (Use 20% that appear 80%)
- "Syntax trivia" (IDE autocomplete)

---

## 🔄 ADAPTIVE TEACHING

**Based on user profile:**
- Background: Chef → Use cooking analogies
- Goal: Backend dev → Prioritize system design
- Weakness: Communication → Focus Tier 2 English

**NOT one-size-fits-all!**

---

## ✅ SUCCESS METRICS

**NOT:**
- "Learned 1000 words"
- "Completed 100 lessons"

**YES:**
- "Negotiated +$10k salary using persuasion tactics"
- "Designed system serving 1M users with patterns learned"
- "Closed $50k deal with presentation skills"
